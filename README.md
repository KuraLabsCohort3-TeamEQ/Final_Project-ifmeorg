### The concept of mental health as a topic of public discourse and concern has been around since the early 1900's but even today, access to care for mental health is difficult.
For our team's final project at Kura Labs, we wanted to deploy an application that is both meaningful to communities across the world, and also raises awareness of the importance of taking care of one's mental health and that care can and should be accessible to anyone. Accordingly, our project provides a collection of tools that individuals can use to record their insights into their own mental health and further share them with trusted allies as they see fit. We seek to advance Health, Empowerment and Community through cloud computing. 

For such, we have chosen an application called if-me.org which "is a community for mental health experiences that encourages people to share their personal stories with trusted allies." -https://www.if-me.org/about

### Creating a visible change
After locating the file with the color variables here:
app/assets/stylesheets/base/_colors.scss

We can choose a color already available, or add a color to the file. After choosing a color we can navigate to:
app/assets/stylesheets/dashboard/dashboard.scss

We decided to change the color of the dashboard background.

**Note this will only change the background color of the dashboard (what you see while logged in) and its contents such as "Moments", "Categories", "Mood", etc. Once you click on the "About", "Blog", or other sections at the top right, the original background color will be displayed.
