### The concept of mental health has been around since the early 1900's but even today, access to care for mental health is difficult
For our team's final project at Kura Labs, we wanted to deploy an application that is both meaningful to communities across the world, and also raise awareness of the importance of taking care of one's mental health and that care can and should be accessible to anyone.

For such, we have chosen an application called if-me.org which "is a community for mental health experiences that encourages people to share their personal stories with trusted allies." -https://www.if-me.org/about
