### The concept of mental health has been around since the early 1900's but even today, access to care for mental health is difficult
For our team's final project at Kura Labs, we wanted to deploy an application that is both meaningful to communities across the world, and also raise awareness of the importance of taking care of one's mental health and that care can and should be accessible to anyone.

For such, we have chosen an application called if-me.org which "is a community for mental health experiences that encourages people to share their personal stories with trusted allies." -https://www.if-me.org/about

Original Repo: [ifmeorg/ifme](https://github.com/ifmeorg/ifme)

### Creating a visible change
After locating the file with the color variables here:
app/assets/stylesheets/base/_colors.scss

We can choose a color already available, or add a color to the file. From there we can navigate to:
app/assets/stylesheets/dashboard/dashboard.scss

We decided to change the color of the dashboard background.

**Note this will only change the background color of the dashboard (what you see while logged in) and its contents such as "Moments", "Categories", "Mood", etc. Once you click on the "About", "Blog", or other sections at the top right, the original background color will be displayed.
